# profile_me_bot

Very hastily hacked together bot to obfuscate patterns in browsing traffic. See OpenWPM/demo.py for a simple demo of the idea. The full OpenWPM will not be needed, though it's present now so that some of its nice features can be used easily, before a paring-down. 

Pull requests welcome; see issues labeled "enhancement." Reminder that the first to get a pull request accepted wins a smartcard!
